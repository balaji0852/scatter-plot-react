# Scatter plot graph component

Hereâ€™s a simple React.js component that serves as a scatter plot and takes a JSON object as input.

### var dataInput =  {
    dataPoints : [ 
      {
          xAxis : 3,
          yAxis : 1083.6,
          color : "brown",
          image : "https://imageurl/testData1.jpg",
          desc : "test Data 1"
      },
      {
          xAxis : 50,
          yAxis : 150,
          color : "red",
          image : "https://imageurl/testData2.jpg",
          desc : "test Data 2"
      }
    ]
}
